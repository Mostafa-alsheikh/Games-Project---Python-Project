# Python Programming Project: Game Development

This project was developed as part of an intermediate programming course, focusing on game development and design. It showcases the application of object-oriented programming principles, user input handling, and basic game mechanics.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a functional game using the principles learned in the course. The game is designed to be interactive and provides the player with an engaging experience. Key features of the project include:

- **User Input Handling**: The game processes user input to control game elements, such as characters or objects.
- **Game Mechanics**: Includes basic game logic, such as win conditions, score tracking, and interaction between game entities.
- **Graphics and User Interface**: The game uses simple graphics to represent elements of the game world, with a focus on intuitive user interfaces.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python (or specify another language if different)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: 
  - Pygame (for game development)
  - Tkinter (for user interface, if used)
  - (Any other libraries or tools used)
  
## Features

### Game Mechanics
- **Player Movement**: The player can control the movement of a character or object using keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys, WASD).
- **Collision Detection**: The game checks for collisions between the player and other entities, such as obstacles or enemies.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points for specific actions, such as defeating enemies or collecting items.
- **Win/Loss Conditions**: The game ends when certain conditions are met (e.g., player wins after collecting all items or loses if their health reaches zero).
  
### User Interface
- **Menus**: Includes start, pause, and game over screens.
- **Game Display**: Shows the game world, player statistics, and score.
- **Sound Effects**: Background music and sound effects are included to enhance the gaming experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the project, you need the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for game development)
  
You can install Pygame using the following command:
```bash
pip install pygame
